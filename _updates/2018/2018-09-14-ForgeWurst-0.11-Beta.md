## Changelog

- Added AntiSpam hack: Blocks chat spam by adding a counter to repeated messages.

- Added a "Repair mode" checkbox to AutoTool. When checked, AutoTool will prevent you from using tools that are about to break by switching to a different slot (preferably one that is empty or cannot be damaged).

- Replaced the "Tracers" checkbox in PlayerESP, MobESP, ItemESP and ChestESP with a "Style" setting that lets you choose between boxes, lines or both.
